# Experimental APIs

This folder contains APIs that are not yet considered stable, and are entirely subject to change.
Some of these APIs solve the same problems in different ways, and not all of them will be stabalized.

## Using experimental APIs

Experimental APIs are available under the `experimental` namespace from the `svelte-relay` package.

```typescript
import { experimental } from 'svelte-relay';
```
